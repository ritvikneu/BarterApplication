# BarterApplication


Project Summary:
This project aims to create a Full Stack Application to enable users to trade goods and services among each other. The application will use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and will have a user-friendly interface and a secure database.

This is a marketplace application for students(barter) to trade/exchange goods and services among themselves without involvement of any payment

Goods - a physical product put up in the marketplace 
Service - a physical/virtual product/offering put up in the marketplace
Have - A Good/Service owned by a barter and ready for trade
Need - A Good/Service a barter hoping to find in the marketplace

Project Flow:
1. A barter comes in and registers themselves on the application 
2. Barter sets up their profile 
3. Create any haves/needs on the application and 
4. Browse through the dashboard to find anything(referred as element) that interests them and right away start trading
5. Barter can click the element and get more specific details
6. Request the barter who owns the element and provide an element of own for the trade
7. The other barter logs in and sees the element is appropriate and can confirm and complete the trade

Some more details:
1. The Barter System doesn't allow any trade if there's no good or service owned by a Barter
2. Not more than 3 requests can be made on an element and Barter in power can decide which element to trade on
3. Barters can communicate with each other on an open forum - group chat
4. Look through the metrics in my profile and the overall metrics of the application

Tech Stack:
1. MongoDB cluster for cloud-enabled database
2. Express for routing and managing servers
3. ReactJs for front-end development
4. Nodejs for backend development
5. Cloudinary to host images
6. Firebase for authentication of a barter
7. Firebase Chat for communication
8. Redux Toolkit for store and dispatch operations
9. MUI and Sass for styling
10. React Charts for metrics
